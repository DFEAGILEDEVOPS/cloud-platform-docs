Appendix 1: Platform Principes

This chapter outlines some of the platform principes and how they affect the design or implimentation of the platform. 

Automation, Standardisation and Isolation 
-----------------------------------------

Automation, standardization and isolation provide both speed and saftey.

    As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of 'do it yourself.'

    -- Marshall McLuhan

Computers are very good at repetitive tasks. By maximising automation we free people to do high-value tasks. This leads to the outcome of a happy and sustainable culture of delivery. Automation should, therefore, be maximised. Where decisions should be made by humans, the decision should be to press a literal (or metaphorical) "Big Green Button" when they are ready to make the decision. The outcome of the decision should be automated and immediate. 

    Today’s standardization… is the necessary foundation on which tomorrow’s improvements will be based.  If you think “standardization” as the best you know today, but which is to be improved tomorrow – you get somewhere.  But if you think of standards as confining, then progress stops. 
    
    -- Henry Ford

Standardisation compliments automation by making it possible for new teams to use automation that was built in a specific context and with implicit assumptions. Without standardization, automation cannot be easily shared. An environment that has lots of automation that is specific to many small and repetitive contexts grows in complexity over time. Automation compliments standardization as manual actions may deviate from the intended standard through human error or stale knowledge of the latest standards. 

    Use appropriate isolation.

    -- Paul Cripwell
    
Isolation compliments automation in that the consequence of unanticipated problems can be minimised. Isolation removes the risk allowing an empowered team member to make the decisions to proceed. Often people external to the team are left "in the loop" to compensate for high risks of human error. A remote risk of a very bad outcome is used to justify the substantial costs of waiting for a meeting to bless a decision. The effect of human circuit breakers has a disproportionate when the decision is to be made by a consultatory committee rather than an empowered team member. Good isolation helps mitigate long tail risks allowing teams to avoid the disproportionate costs of decision meeting delays. Decisions should be made at the most appropriate level and good isolation moves the appropriate level into the delivery team. 

Be Open and Agnostic
--------------------

    Be open and agnostic.

    -- Mark O'Neill

Be open and agnostic to be able to deal with change. A platform intended to support agile delivery needs to be flexible and adaptable. This seems counter to the principle that a platform should support standardization and automation. This can be reconciled by being open to extention but closed to modification. This means that the platform should be opinionated in the matters that achieve the vision of being safe and agile. Yet the platform should be flexible to extention in layers that don't affect safety. How code, data and people gets into an environment primarily affects safety. The platform will therefore be opinionated at its boundaries but flexible within the layers that a team can safely control.
