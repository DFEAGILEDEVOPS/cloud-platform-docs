============
The Platform
============

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the platform from a user expective. The primary users of the platform are intended to be teams building or maintaining digital services with a safe and agile self-service devops user experience. 

Principles
----------

The primary principles of the platform are: 

* Automation, standardization and isolation provide both speed and saftey
* Be open and agnostic to be able to deal with change
* Treat infrastructure as code so that it can be provisioned safely and at speed
* Keep state in managed services
* Scale down as well as up to maximise productivity

These principles and examples of how they affect the platform are outlined in `Appendix 1`_. Being explicit about the principles allows people to challenge the model and whether the approach and fits within the wider organization. It also allows pilot users of the platform to point out where the current prototypes or design deviates from the principles.

Design
------

During the pilot, the ground truth of the design is the configuration that builds the OCP plant and templates which deploy sample code from VSTS. The following summary is TBD.
