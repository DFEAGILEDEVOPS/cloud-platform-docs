============
The Platform
============

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the platform from a user expective. The primary users of the platform are intended to be teams building or maintaining digital services with a safe and agile self-service devops user experience. 

Principles
----------

The primary principles of the platform are: 

* Automation, standardization and isolation provide both speed and saftey
* Be open and agnostic to be able to deal with change
* Treat infrastructure as code so that it can be provisioned safely and at speed
* Keep state in managed services
* Scale down as well as up to maximise productivity

These principles and examples of how they affect the platform are outlined in `Appendix 1`_. Being explicit about the principles allows people to challenge the model and point out any deviatations from the platform principles.
