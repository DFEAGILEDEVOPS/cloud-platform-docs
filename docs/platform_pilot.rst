==================
The Platform Pilot
==================

Vision
------

Build a safe and agile digital *platform* for digital service builders to stand-up their work upon. 

| platform
| /platfɔːm/
| *noun*
| 1. a raised level surface on which people or things can stand

|

The project name is "Agile Continuous Delivery Platform Pilot" which reflects that the 
platform will support continuous delivery using agile governance.

    The tools that public servants use, the space they work in and the governance and processes in place to support, enable and assure delivery of brilliant public services are therefore all essential to digital government.

Platform Goals
--------------

Make it easy [*]_ for a .Net Core 2.0 or R Shiny project to get deployed on department infrastructure. 

.. note::
    The platform is language, framework and cloud agnostic. The initial focus on .Net Core and R Shiny for the pilot 
    reflects that we have civil servants using those technologies. 

Pilot Aims
----------

By the end of platform pilot we will have a consistent way of building, deploying, 
and running a digital service alpha that a team can set-up in less than one hour.
